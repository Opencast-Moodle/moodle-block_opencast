moodle-block_opencast
=====================

This block can be used to link moodle courses to opencast series.
Users with respective privileges (in the following called teacher) can use this block to upload videos via moodle to opencast. 
These videos are transmitted to the opencast system by the cronjob and create a event for the respective series there.
The block can be used to automatically set the access privileges of moodle users enrolled in the course.
All events belonging to the series are displayed in the block. 
This way, the teacher gets an overview of all recorded lectures as well as planned ones.
Further, if setup correctly, the teacher is able to restrict the visibility to moodle groups or prevent access by students at all.

Usage scenarios
---------------

In the following 3 use cases are described, how the plugin can be used.

### Use case 1 - Upload a video ###
The teacher of a course wants to upload the video "Lecture 1" to his Moodle course.
Prerequisite: The course page already contains an instance of the Block "Opencast Videos".

Steps to upload a video:

1. Clicking on "Add video" leads to an upload form.
2. Here the teacher can upload a video file to moodle:</br>

3. Saving the form creates an upload job, which is registered to the Upload Job Queue.</br>

4. The processing of a video is done during a cron job and contain the following steps:
    1. A new series is created in opencast with the name which was set in the settings, if it is not yet created.
    2. A new group is created in opencast with the name which was set in the settings, if it is not yet created. This step is skipped if "Create a group" is not selected in the settings.
    This group control the access to the video.
    3. The video is uploaded to opencast, if it does not yet exist or the config *reuseexistingupload* is false.
    In this step all permanent and non-permanent ACL-Rules are assigned to the video.
    4. The group is assigned to the video.
    
Since most operations in the upload process are done by opencast in an asynchronous fashion, uploading a video can take multiple runs of the cronjob to finish.


## Use case 2 - Change the visibility ###
The teacher of a course wants to hide an uploaded video from the students.
The (opencast) admin has definded student specific roles.

Steps to change the visibility:

1. Go to the overview section of the block.</br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9437254/46022814-9da8e180-c0e3-11e8-9040-848952089afe.png" width="500"></br>
2. Click on the visibility icon.
3. In the visibility form the teacher can select the needed visibility state.</br>

4. The processing of the video starts:
    1. The ACL-Roles of the video are changed and updated in Opencast.
    2. A workflow (must be defined in the settings) is started which refreshes the metadata.
    
## Use case 3 - Linking a recorded series ###

A teacher wants to link an existing series to his moodle course and control the access to these videos using the list of students in his moodle course.
For this the series id has to be reference in the block.

1. Go to the overview section of the block.
2. Go to "Edit series mapping".</br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9437254/46022815-9da8e180-c0e3-11e8-969c-15e0bbab4417.png" width="500"></br>
3. Enter the series id and save the form.
4. Now all videos of the series should be displayed in the block and the visibility of them can be adjusted.
