      | group_creation_1                 | 0                                                             | block_opencast |
      | group_name_1                     | Moodle_course_[COURSEID]                                      | block_opencast |

      | addactivityepisodeenabled_1      | 1                                                             | block_opencast |

    And I setup the opencast test api
    And I upload a testvideo
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add the "Opencast Videos" block
    And I log out

  Scenario: When the feature is enabled and working, editing teachers are able to add the LTI module to the course
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on "Go to overview..." "link"
    And I click on "Add Opencast episode module to course" "link"
    And I click on "Add module and return to course" "button"
    And I should see "The 'Test video' episode module has been added to this course."
    And I should see "Test video" in the "li.activity" "css_element"
    When I click on "Go to overview..." "link"
    Then "View Opencast episode module in course" "link" should exist
    And "Add Opencast episode module to course" "link" should not exist
