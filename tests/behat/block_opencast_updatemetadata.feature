Feature: Update video metadata as Teacher
  In order to update video metadata
  As teacher
  I need to be able to view and modify the metadata of a video

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                | idnumber |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com | T1       |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | config              | value                                                         | plugin         |
      | apiurl_1            | http://testapi:8080                                           | tool_opencast  |
      | apipassword_1       | opencast                                                      | tool_opencast  |
      | apiusername_1       | admin                                                         | tool_opencast  |
      | ocinstances         | [{"id":1,"name":"Default","isvisible":true,"isdefault":true}] | tool_opencast  |
      | limituploadjobs_1   | 0                                                             | block_opencast |
      | group_creation_1    | 0                                                             | block_opencast |
      | group_name_1        | Moodle_course_[COURSEID]                                      | block_opencast |
      | series_name_1       | Course_Series_[COURSEID]                                      | block_opencast |
      | enablechunkupload_1 | 0                                                             | block_opencast |
      | workflow_roles_1    | republish-metadata                                            | block_opencast |
      | metadata_1          | [{"name":"title","datatype":"text","required":1,"readonly":0,"param_json":null}] | block_opencast |
    And I setup the opencast test api
    And I upload a testvideo
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add the "Opencast Videos" block

  @javascript
  Scenario: When the update metadata form is loaded, the video metadata are loaded in the form
    When I click on "Go to overview..." "link"
    And I click on "#opencast-videos-table-1234-1234-1234-1234-1234_r0 .c7 .action-menu a" "css_element"
    And I click on "Update metadata" "link"
    Then I should see "Update metadata"
    And the field "Title" matches value "Test video"
    When I set the field "Title" to "New title"
    And I click on "Save changes" "button"
    Then I should see "Metadata is saved"
